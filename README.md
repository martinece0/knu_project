# French License Plate Detection and Recognition System  

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a system for detecting and reading French license plates from images using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. The project is designed to:  
- Automate the process of license plate detection in various lighting and environmental conditions.  
- Preprocess detected license plates to improve text recognition accuracy.  
- Correct typical OCR errors specific to French license plates.  

**Motivation:**  
The need for efficient and accurate license plate recognition is essential in traffic management, parking systems, and vehicle surveillance. This project showcases how computer vision and OCR can address real-world challenges in these domains.

## 🌟 Key Results  
- **High Detection Accuracy:** Achieved reliable detection of license plates under controlled conditions (e.g., clear images and minimal obstructions).  
- **Improved OCR Performance:** Text correction algorithms significantly reduce recognition errors, achieving a valid plate detection rate of over **85%** on test images.  
- **Fast Processing:** On average, the system processes an image in less than **1 second** on a modern laptop.

## 📈 Performance Metrics  

| **Metric**               | **Value**               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Detection Accuracy       | ~90%                   |
| OCR Accuracy (Post-Correction) | ~85%            |
| Processing Time per Image| ~0.8s                  |
| Memory Usage             | < 200 MB               |

> **Note:** Performance may vary depending on the quality of input images.

### ⚙️ Installation and Usage  

#### Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-recognition.git
   cd license-plate-recognition
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system. For macOS, use:  
   ```bash
   brew install tesseract
   ```

#### Usage  
1. uses one of the images in the `images/` folder. The repository includes **28 test images** to try. 


2. Open the `main.py` file and set the `image_path` variable to point to the desired test image:
   ```python
   image_path = "images/voiture_1.jpg"  # Example test image
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. The program will display the detected license plate with contours, the preprocessed plate, and the recognized text directly in the console.
