# License Plate Detection and Recognition System  

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a system for detecting and reading French license plates from images using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. The project is designed to:  
- Automate the process of license plate detection in various lighting and environmental conditions.  
- Preprocess detected license plates to improve text recognition accuracy.  
- Correct typical OCR errors specific to French license plates.  

**Motivation:**  
The need for efficient and accurate license plate recognition is essential in traffic management, parking systems, and vehicle surveillance. This project showcases how computer vision and OCR can address real-world challenges in these domains.

---

## 🌟 Key Results  
- **High Detection Accuracy:** Achieved reliable detection of license plates under controlled conditions (e.g., clear images and minimal obstructions).  
- **Improved OCR Performance:** Text correction algorithms significantly reduce recognition errors, achieving a valid plate detection rate of over **85%** on test images.  
- **Fast Processing:** On average, the system processes an image in less than **1 second** on a modern laptop.
